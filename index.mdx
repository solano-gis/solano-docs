title: "What is SAGE?"
description: "Solano Agent for Geographic Enquiry — an AI-powered GIS assistant for Solano County"
---

SAGE is an AI assistant that integrates Solano County's fragmented data infrastructure into a single conversational interface. It connects live GIS services, public records, regulatory codes, budget documents, and an interactive map — all accessible through natural language.

It is not a chatbot. It is a **collaborative spatial analyst** that shares an interactive map with users, autonomously chains multi-step queries across 59 specialized tools, and synthesizes answers grounded in real county data.

## What makes SAGE different

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Shared map" icon="map">
    AI and user see the same interactive ArcGIS map. When SAGE pans, zooms, or highlights parcels, you see it happen. When you click a parcel, SAGE sees it too.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real data, not training data" icon="database">
    Every answer comes from live queries to county GIS services, the Assessor's database, county code, General Plan, and budget documents — not model hallucinations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Autonomous tool chaining" icon="link">
    Ask one question, get a multi-step analysis. SAGE decides which tools to call, in what order, building on each result. A property research query may chain 5-8 tools automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Four independent services" icon="server">
    Each service has a clear failure boundary and a defensible answer to "what data does the AI access?" and "what happens if it breaks?"

## Capabilities

**Property research** — Look up any address or APN. Get parcel details, zoning, flood zones, fire hazard, elevation, school districts, assessed values, building characteristics, and nearby amenities.

**Regulatory analysis** — Search the Solano County Code (zoning, subdivisions, grading, underground utilities). Query the 2008 General Plan across 12 chapters. Find specific policies and implementation programs.

**Budget and staffing** — Search the FY2025-26 Recommended Budget. Explore 3,284 county positions across departments, divisions, and job classifications.

**Spatial queries** — Count features, calculate statistics, and group results across 30+ map layers in any visible extent. Filter by zoning, use code, acreage, assessed value, year built, and more.

**Aerial vision** — AI analyzes map screenshots to detect buildings, pools, solar panels, aircraft, and other features. Converts pixel coordinates to real-world lat/lng for follow-up queries.

**Board of Supervisors** — Search meeting minutes and agendas. Find decisions, votes, and action items by topic or date.

**Driving directions** — Route calculations and travel time between any two locations in the county.
