title: "What is SAGE?"
description: "Solano Agent for Geographic Enquiry — an AI-powered GIS assistant for Solano County"
---

SAGE is an AI assistant that connects Solano County's data sources into one chat interface. It integrates live GIS services, public records, regulatory codes, budget documents, and an interactive map — all accessible through natural language.

A spatial analyst that shares an interactive map with users, chains multi-step queries across 59 tools, and answers using real county data.

## What makes SAGE different

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Shared map" icon="map">
    AI and user see the same interactive ArcGIS map. When SAGE pans, zooms, or highlights parcels, you see it happen. When you click a parcel, SAGE sees it too.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real data, not training data" icon="database">
    Queries live county GIS services, Assessor's database, county code, General Plan, and budget — not training data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Autonomous tool chaining" icon="link">
    SAGE decides which tools to call and chains them automatically.

  <Card title="Four independent services" icon="server">
    Each service has a clear failure boundary and a known data access scope.

## Capabilities

**Property research** — Look up any address or APN. Get parcel details, zoning, flood zones, fire hazard, elevation, school districts, assessed values, building characteristics, and nearby amenities.

**Regulatory analysis** — Search the Solano County Code (zoning, subdivisions, grading, underground utilities). Query the 2008 General Plan across 12 chapters. Find specific policies and implementation programs.

**Budget and staffing** — Search the FY2025-26 Recommended Budget. Explore 3,284 county positions across departments, divisions, and job classifications.

**Spatial queries** — Count features, calculate statistics, and group results across 30+ map layers in any visible extent. Filter by zoning, use code, acreage, assessed value, year built, and more.

**Aerial vision** — AI analyzes map screenshots to detect buildings, pools, solar panels, aircraft, and other features. Converts pixel coordinates to real-world lat/lng for follow-up queries.

**Board of Supervisors** — Search meeting minutes and agendas. Find decisions, votes, and action items by topic or date.

**Driving directions** — Route calculations and travel time between any two locations in the county.
