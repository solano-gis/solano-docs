sage-gov is the public records engine. It provides 30 MCP tools for searching and retrieving government documents — budget, county code, General Plan, organizational chart, and Board of Supervisors meeting minutes. All data is static, public, and bundled at deploy time.

<Note>
sage-gov makes **zero external API calls** at runtime. All data is pre-processed JSON files shipped with the deployment. This means zero latency from external services and zero risk of exposing internal systems.

## Data pipeline

Data is pre-processed offline and committed to the repository:

1. **County Code** — Scraped from Solano County Code website → parsed HTML → structured JSON per chapter
2. **General Plan** — Extracted from PDF → chunked by section → embedded for semantic search
3. **Budget** — Extracted from PDF → chunked by department → embedded for semantic search
4. **Org Chart** — Position Allocation Report + Salary Listing → parsed → structured JSON
5. **Meeting Minutes** — Scraped from county meeting portal → parsed → structured JSON

Updates require re-running the import scripts and redeploying.
