**Repository:** `solano-gis/sage-map` | **Deployed to:** `sage-map.vercel.app` | **Tech:** Next.js 15, @arcgis/core 4.34

sage-map is the interactive map component. It runs as a standalone Next.js application embedded as an iframe in sage-web. It has **zero MCP tools** and **zero AI** — it is purely a visualization and interaction layer.

SAGE and the user share this map. When the AI highlights parcels or toggles layers, the user sees it happen in real time. When the user clicks a parcel, the AI sees the result.

## Capabilities

### Map presets

Four pre-configured ArcGIS Online web maps, switchable on demand:

| Preset | Web Map ID | Layers |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `parcels` | `cb295007...` | Parcels with APN labels, address points, city/county boundaries |
| `planning` | `ad2ccb37...` | Zoning districts, general plan designations |
| `hazards` | `1522f216...` | FEMA flood zones, fire hazard severity, earthquake faults |
| `master` | `aefdec7f...` | All layers combined (30+) |

### Layer management

- **30+ data layers** including aerials (2004-2025), parcels, zoning (county + 7 cities), general plans, flood zones, fire hazard, LiDAR, demographics, earthquake faults
- **Layer pairs** — VectorTileLayer (fast rendering) paired with FeatureLayer (queries/identify). Visibility synced automatically.
- **Dynamic layers** — External REST services can be added at runtime via `add-layer` command

### Feature highlighting

Two highlight commands enable the AI to visually mark features on the shared map:

- **`highlight-apns`** — Highlights specific parcels by APN. Orange polygon outlines, zooms to fit.
- **`highlight-features`** — Highlights any queryable FeatureServer layer by SQL WHERE expression. Geometry-adaptive symbols: orange polygon outlines, orange polylines, or orange circle markers depending on feature type. Capped at 5,000 features per query (`maxRecordCountFactor: 5` overrides server-side `maxRecordCount` limits).

Both commands auto-zoom to fit the highlighted features using extent-based zoom with 1.5× padding (capped at zoom level 18 for small features).

The `highlight-features` ack includes metadata: `featureCount`, `exceededLimit`, `fieldNames`, `layerTitle`, `where`, and `geometryType`. sage-web surfaces this in the tool output so the AI can decide whether to run follow-up attribute queries. Feature attributes are already loaded on each graphic (via `outFields: ['*']`) but are not sent to the AI automatically — the AI controls when to request data via `query_map_features`.

Examples: `where: "zone_abrev = 'R-1'"` highlights all R-1 zoning districts; `where: "valland > 500000"` highlights high-value parcels.

### AI annotations

The AI draws directly on the map using the `annotate` command — markers, lines, polygons, circles, and text labels. Annotations appear on a dedicated `GraphicsLayer` above all data layers but below the sketch layer.

**Color palette** — six constrained colors, chosen for contrast against both aerial imagery and light basemaps. Orange is excluded (reserved for parcel/feature highlights).

| Name | Hex | Typical use |
|------|-----|-------------|
| `crimson` | `#DC2626` | Boundaries, danger, warnings |
| `emerald` | `#059669` | Natural areas, parks |
| `cobalt` | `#2563EB` | Water, infrastructure (default) |
| `violet` | `#7C3AED` | Special or unique features |
| `teal` | `#0D9488` | Alternative to green |
| `slate` | `#475569` | Subtle reference lines |

Polygons and circles are **outline-only by default**. The AI sets `filled: true` when area shading helps (rendered at 18% opacity).

**Hand-drawn jitter** — AI-drawn lines, polygons, and circles are post-processed with vertex subdivision and random perturbation to produce an Excalidraw-style sketchy look. This serves two purposes: better aesthetics and a visual signal that AI geometry is approximate, not survey-grade. The jitter is deterministic (seeded PRNG) and scales with map resolution so it looks consistent at any zoom.

Annotations are grouped by ID so the AI can clear and redraw specific sets without affecting others.

### User freehand drawing (draw-to-ask)

Users can draw directly on the map using the pencil button (embed mode only). This enables a "draw-to-ask" workflow — circle an area, draw an arrow, sketch a boundary, then ask the AI about it.

- **Persistent strokes** — drawings stay on the map until the user clears them (trash icon appears when strokes exist)
- **Per-stroke geometry** — each stroke is summarized with its bounding box and centroid, sent to the AI on the next message
- **Screenshot context** — the AI receives both the stroke summaries and a screenshot showing the drawings, enabling vision-based spatial reasoning
- **No auto-clear** — unlike highlights, user drawings persist across AI responses so the user can keep adding

The freehand tool uses ArcGIS `SketchViewModel` in `polyline` + `freehand` mode with orange strokes (SAGE brand color). Vertex symbols are hidden during active drawing for a clean visual.

### Parcel interaction

- **Click** → `parcel-clicked` event with APN, address, coordinates
- **Identify mode** → Click queries all visible layers at point, returns features + screenshot
- **Multi-select** → Shift+click to build a selection of parcels, then "Ask AI" about the group

### Screenshots for AI vision

After every command or state change:
1. Map waits for rendering to complete (`view.updating === false` + 200ms buffer)
2. Captures screenshot at 1092×1092 pixels, JPEG 75% quality
3. Sends base64 data URL back to sage-web via postMessage
4. sage-web validates (format, dimensions, decode) with one retry on failure
5. Screenshot attached to next AI context so Claude can describe what it sees

### High-resolution tiles

Custom `HiResTileLayer` fetches 4 tiles at LOD+1 and composites them into a single tile — giving 2x detail at any zoom level. Essential for readable screenshots.

### Widgets

- Scale bar (bottom-left)
- Live coordinate display (bottom-right, follows cursor)
- Layer list with visibility toggles (top-right)
- Legend (top-right)
- Basemap gallery (top-right)
- Search for addresses and parcels (top-left)
- Identify button (top-left)
- Selection badge (embed mode, for multi-parcel "Ask AI")

## Embed mode

When loaded with `?embed=true`, sage-map optimizes for iframe context:
- Hides header/footer
- Collapses layer list by default
- Shows selection badge for multi-parcel workflows
- Enables freehand drawing tool (pencil button, top-left)
- Posts all events to parent window via postMessage

Typical iframe URL:
```
https://sage-map.vercel.app/map?preset=parcels&embed=true&mapId=sage-canvas-map
```

`lib/shared/map-protocol/index.ts` is the **canonical** copy of the postMessage protocol. sage-web has a copy that must be kept in sync. After editing, copy the file to sage-web and run `npm test` to verify the checksum matches.
