description: "How SAGE addresses organizational risk for government IT adoption"
---

This page is for technical decision makers evaluating whether SAGE's architecture conveys organizational risk. It addresses the questions an IT governance review would ask.

## What data does the AI access?

<Note>
SAGE queries the same public data sources that already power the county's existing web applications. It cannot access any data that isn't already publicly available.
</Note>

| Data source | Access method | Sensitivity | Write access |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Parcels, zoning, hazards | ArcGIS REST (public FeatureServer) | Public | None |
| County Code | Static JSON (bundled at deploy) | Public | None |
| General Plan | Static JSON (bundled at deploy) | Public | None |
| FY2025-26 Budget | Static JSON (bundled at deploy) | Public | None |
| Org chart / positions | Static JSON (bundled at deploy) | Public | None |
| Meeting minutes | Static JSON (bundled at deploy) | Public | None |
| Aerial imagery | ArcGIS tile services | Public | None |
| FEMA flood zones | Federal MapServer | Public | None |
| CAL FIRE hazard zones | State MapServer | Public | None |

**No access to:** Internal networks, employee records, financial systems, email, Active Directory, or any non-public county system.

## What can go wrong?

### AI gives wrong information

**Risk:** Claude misinterprets zoning codes, hallucinates permit exemptions, or chains tools incorrectly.

**Mitigation:**
- Every answer cites specific data sources (parcel numbers, code sections, policy numbers)
- System prompt instructs the AI to report data, not give advice
- Disclaimers on every response: "This is for informational purposes only"
- Users can verify any claim by clicking through to source data
- Role-based deployment tiers with proportional guardrails

### Service goes down

**Risk:** Vercel outage or deployment failure.

**Mitigation:**
- Four independent services — each fails independently
- sage-gov and sage-gis continue working if sage-web is down (they're standard MCP servers)
- sage-map continues as a standalone map viewer
- No shared database or state between services
- Vercel provides 99.99% uptime SLA on Pro plan

### Model provider changes

**Risk:** Anthropic changes pricing, availability, or capabilities of Claude.

**Mitigation:**
- sage-web supports multiple model providers (Claude, GPT, Gemini) via Vercel AI SDK
- MCP servers are model-agnostic — any AI system can consume them
- Tool definitions and data pipelines are independent of the AI model
- Switching models requires changing one configuration value

### Prompt injection or adversarial use

**Risk:** Users craft inputs that cause the AI to behave unexpectedly.

**Mitigation:**
- System prompt constrains behavior to Solano County topics
- Input classification layer (planned for public deployment)
- Output validation layer scans for inappropriate recommendations
- All conversations can be logged and audited
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Structured entry points for public tier (guided workflows, not free chat)

## Deployment tiers

SAGE is designed for progressive deployment with increasing guardrails:

| Tier | Audience | Size | Guardrails |
|------|----------|------|-----------|
| **1 — GIS Staff** | Ryan's team | ~5 | Minimal. Professional users who know the data. |
| **2 — County Staff** | Planners, Resource Mgmt, Econ Dev | ~20-50 | Azure AD SSO, topic scoping, strong disclaimers, 10-step chain cap |
| **3 — Public** | Citizens, businesses | Unlimited | Input classifier, output validator, structured entry points, 5-step cap |

Each tier is a separate deployment configuration of the same codebase. The architecture doesn't change — only the policy layer in sage-web.

## Vendor dependencies

| Dependency | Vendor | Cost | Alternatives | Lock-in risk |
|-----------|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| AI model | Anthropic (Claude) | Usage-based | OpenAI, Google | Low — AI SDK abstracts providers |
| Hosting | Vercel | ~$20/mo per service | Any Node.js host | Low — standard Next.js |
| GIS services | Esri (ArcGIS Online) | Existing county license | — | Already committed county-wide |
| Map SDK | Esri (@arcgis/core) | Included in license | OpenLayers, Mapbox | Medium — significant rewrite |
| Image generation | FAL.ai | Usage-based | Any image API | Low — single tool |
| Vision detection | Google (Gemini Flash) | Usage-based | Any vision model | Low — single tool |

**Key point:** SAGE runs on top of the county's existing ArcGIS investment. It doesn't replace Esri — it makes the existing infrastructure more accessible.

## Accessibility

### SAGE is more accessible than existing GIS tools

Traditional GIS web applications require mouse-driven map interaction, visual interpretation of symbology, and click-identify workflows that are meaningless to a screen reader. SAGE's chat interface inverts this — users can perform full parcel analysis, zoning lookups, hazard assessments, and spatial queries through natural language text.

A screen reader on a conventional map app says: *"Map widget, interactive content."* SAGE says: *"The parcel at 123 Oak St is a 0.4 acre lot zoned R-1 in the Suisun Valley, outside FEMA flood zones, with moderate fire hazard severity. The aerial shows mature trees covering roughly 40% of the lot."*

This is not a retrofit. SAGE's architecture requires the AI to observe the same visual state the user sees, which makes natural language description a built-in capability rather than an afterthought.

### How the vision feedback loop enables this

Every map interaction follows a ground-truth verification cycle:

1. AI sends a map command (pan, zoom, toggle layer, highlight parcel)
2. sage-map executes the command and captures a screenshot of the result
3. The screenshot is returned to the AI via the `command-ack` message
4. If the screenshot doesn't arrive within 8 seconds, the AI is told the action is **unconfirmed** — it cannot assume what the map shows

This means the AI always has a current, verified view of what the user sees. It never hallucinates about map state because it is not allowed to assume — it must observe. For a visually impaired user, the AI becomes a domain-expert narrator: it has the screenshot, the attribute data from tool calls, and the context from the conversation to produce descriptions far richer than any static alt text.

### Compliance posture

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Chat interface | Strong | Text-in, text-out. Inherently screen reader compatible. Keyboard navigation needs audit. |
| Map viewer (sage-map) | Esri's responsibility | Built on @arcgis/core + Calcite Design System. Covered by [Esri's published VPATs](https://www.esri.com/en-us/accessibility/conformance-reports). |
| AI-generated images | Supplementary | Oblique photos, infographics are enhancements. Primary information delivery is text. |
| Overall | Exceeds baseline | Chat provides a text-based alternative to visual-only GIS workflows — something existing county map apps do not offer. |

<Note>
ADA Title II requires state and local governments (population 50,000+) to meet WCAG 2.1 AA by April 24, 2026. SAGE's chat-first architecture positions it well for compliance. The map component relies on Esri's Calcite Design System, which Esri maintains for Section 508 conformance.
</Note>

## What SAGE is not

- **Not a replacement for GIS staff.** It's a tool that makes their expertise more accessible.
- **Not a decision-making system.** It retrieves and synthesizes data. Decisions remain with humans.
- **Not connected to internal systems.** It queries the same public data as any county website visitor.
- **Not a black box.** Every tool call, data source, and response is traceable and auditable.
- **Not dependent on a single vendor.** The AI model, hosting, and data sources are all substitutable.

## Integration with existing infrastructure

SAGE is designed to integrate, not replace:

- **ArcGIS Online** — Queries existing published services. No new services required.
- **County website** — Can be embedded as a component or linked as a standalone tool.
- **Azure AD** — Planned SSO integration for staff deployment (Tier 2).
- **Existing workflows** — Staff continue using ArcGIS Pro, the parcel viewer, and other tools. SAGE is additive.

## Open source

All SAGE repositories are in the `solano-gis` GitHub organization. The architecture is designed to be replicable by any county with ArcGIS services — swap the data endpoints, update the system prompt, deploy.
