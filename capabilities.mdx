description: "Everything SAGE can do — organized by what users ask, not how the code works"
---

SAGE has 70 tools across three services, 10 knowledge domains, and a shared interactive map. This page catalogs what the AI can do, organized by capability rather than implementation.

For how these capabilities are built, see [Architecture](/architecture). For the knowledge system, see [Knowledge Base](/knowledge).

## Property & Parcels

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Address geocoding | Convert any Solano County address to coordinates and APN |
| Property profile | Assessment values, building details (beds/baths/sqft/year built), Williamson Act status, use codes, exemptions, liens |
| Street-level parcel search | Find all parcels on a street by name (e.g., all properties on Texas St in Fairfield) |
| Criteria-based parcel search | Filter parcels by zoning, use type, acreage range, value range, year built, pools, solar, city, Williamson Act |
| Nearby parcels | Find all parcels within a specified radius of a parcel or point, with distance measurements |
| Nearby amenities | Find schools, parks, fire stations, hospitals, libraries, police, transit stops, and community centers within radius |
| Oblique aerial imagery | Sanborn 5-angle photography (N/S/E/W + nadir) at any address — see buildings from the side, not just above |
| LiDAR elevation | Surface model (DSM), terrain model (DTM), and canopy height (CHM) at 1-foot resolution from 2023 county LiDAR |
| Terrain analysis | Slope (degrees, percent, classification), aspect (compass direction), and elevation detail at any point — Horn's method on a 3×3 LiDAR grid at 1ft resolution |

## Zoning & Land Use

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Zoning designation | Query zoning for any location — automatically routes to the correct jurisdiction (7 incorporated cities + unincorporated county) |
| County Code lookup | Full text of zoning and land use code chapters (19, 23, 24, 26, 26.5, 28, 30, 31) |
| County Code search | Keyword search across all available code sections |
| General Plan policy | Search the 2008 General Plan across 12 chapters — policies, goals, implementation programs, appendices |
| Permitted use analysis | Combines zoning designation + county code sections to determine what's allowed on a property |

## Hazards

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| FEMA flood zone | Zone designation (A, AE, X, etc.), Special Flood Hazard Area status, insurance implications |
| CAL FIRE hazard zone | Fire Hazard Severity Zone classification (Moderate / High / Very High), State vs Local Responsibility Area |
| Earthquake fault zones | Alquist-Priolo fault zone proximity via spatial layer query |
| Multi-hazard assessment | Chains flood + fire + seismic lookups into a combined hazard profile for any property |

## Government & Budget

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Budget search | Full-text search of the FY2025-26 Recommended Budget ($1.65B) by department, keyword, or section |
| Department budgets | Complete budget detail for any county department — revenue, expenditures, fund sources |
| Org chart navigation | Browse 3,285 FTE across all departments, divisions, and positions |
| Position search | Find any job title or classification across all departments county-wide |
| Department comparison | Side-by-side staffing metrics between multiple departments |
| Meeting minutes | Search Board of Supervisors and ReGIS committee meeting minutes, agendas, votes, resolutions, and action items |
| Supervisor district | Identify which Board of Supervisors district (1-5) a location falls in, with supervisor contact info |
| Special districts | Identify all overlapping special districts at a point — fire, water, school, garbage, cemetery, GSA, reclamation |

## Maps & Visualization

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Static map images | Server-rendered map snapshots embedded inline in chat responses |
| Interactive map canvas | Live ArcGIS map shared between AI and user via iframe — both see the same state |
| Map navigation | AI pans, zooms, and navigates to coordinates, addresses, or parcels |
| Layer toggling | AI shows or hides any layer — parcels, zoning, aerials, hazards, boundaries, and more |
| Parcel highlighting | Highlight specific parcels by APN on the interactive map with yellow outlines |
| Feature highlighting | Highlight features by attribute expression (e.g., all parcels zoned A-40, all Very High fire hazard zones) |
| Map legend/symbology | AI reads layer renderer data (field, values, labels, colors) to describe what map colors represent |
| Map vision | Every map command returns a screenshot the AI analyzes before responding |
| Object detection | Vision model (Gemini Flash) locates objects in map screenshots (buildings, pools, solar panels, aircraft) and converts pixel positions to real-world coordinates |
| Inline charts | Bar, horizontal bar, pie, donut, line, and area charts rendered inline in chat — supports currency, percent, and acres formatting |
| PDF map export | Professional cartographic PDF with title, scale bar, north arrow — inherits full symbology from the Solano Master Web Map |
| AI infographics | Diagrams, comparison graphics, and visualizations generated via AI image generation |

## Spatial Analysis

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Feature counting | Count features in any map layer within a bounding box or the current map view |
| Attribute sampling | Retrieve the first N features with attributes, sorted by any field (e.g., top 10 parcels by acreage) |
| Aggregate statistics | Sum, average, min, max with GROUP BY across any queryable layer (e.g., total acreage by zoning type) |
| Polygon spatial filter | Use polygon geometry from one layer to filter another — e.g., count parcels inside a specific FEMA flood zone polygon, not just its bounding box |
| Spatial relationships | Query with `intersects`, `contains`, `within`, `touches`, or `crosses` for adjacency and containment questions |
| Driving directions | Turn-by-turn routes via ESRI World Route Service between any two locations |
| Travel time | Point-to-point travel time and distance estimates |
| Buffer analysis | Buffer polygons around parcels or points via ESRI Geometry Service — extends from the parcel boundary, not the centroid. CA State Plane Zone 2 (US survey feet). |
| Notification lists | Buffer → spatial query to find all parcels within a radius — the workflow for CEQA/permit notification requirements |
| Point-in-polygon query | Query any registered map layer at a point — general plan designation, garbage service area, subdivisions, wildlife hazard zones, demographics |
| Cross-layer overlay | Geometric intersection of two layers with overlap area calculation — answers "how many acres of A-40 zoned land are in the AE flood zone?" |
| Polygon union | Merge multiple parcels or polygon features into a single combined boundary — for project site assembly or multi-parcel analysis |

## GIS Data Discovery

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Layer catalog | Browse 30+ GIS layers across 11 categories (property, zoning, hazards, districts, services, POI, infrastructure, emergency, environmental, demographics, basemap) |
| Layer search | Keyword or natural language search to find relevant GIS layers |
| Field inspection | View field names, types, and query patterns for any layer |
| Data downloads | Links to downloadable GIS datasets — Shapefile, Geodatabase, LiDAR, GeoJSON, CSV, KML |
| Geoprocessing | Dissolve shapefiles by attribute field to create boundary polygons |

## Domain Knowledge

| budget-staffing | Budget structure navigation, staffing analysis patterns, department comparison strategies |
| county-overview | Geography, demographics, economy, cities, landmarks, transportation, history |
| general-plan-policy | Policy research patterns across 12 General Plan chapters |
| jurisdiction-services | City vs county routing, special district semantics, disclaimers |
| maps-spatial | Layer discovery strategies, aerial imagery guide, map visualization patterns |
| meetings-governance | Meeting search patterns, committee coverage, date ranges |

<Note>
All capabilities query the same public data sources that power the county's existing web applications. SAGE cannot access any data that isn't already publicly available. See [Risk & Governance](/governance) for the full data access inventory.
